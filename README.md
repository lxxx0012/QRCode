QR Code Management Application
This application allows users to generate and manage dynamic QR codes. 
A key feature of this project is the ability to use a static physical QR code (such as one built from LEGO) 
and dynamically update its destination URL through a web dashboard without needing to change the physical LEGO QR code block.

🚀 Key Features
Dynamic Redirection: Update the destination URL of your QR codes in real-time.

Management Dashboard: Intuitive UI to create, track, and edit QR code data.

LEGO Integration: Specifically designed to support static, physical QR builds with digital flexibility.

Collaborative Development: Built with a focus on clean version control and efficient debugging.
